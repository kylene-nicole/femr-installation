# fEMR - Fast Electronic Medical Records

### Attention Developers - Need to update the instructions?
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kylene-phillips/femr-installation/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## Description
fEMR is a fast EMR solution for remote clinics who depend on speed and ease of use rather than complex features. Check out [Team fEMR's website](https://teamfemr.org/) for more information and a live demo.
